Israel says airstrikes it launched into Gaza Monday have destroyed nine homes belonging to "high-ranking commanders" in Hamas and nine miles of tunnels used by the militant group.  
"That's 9.3 miles that can no longer be used for terror," the Israel Defense Forces said in a tweet. 
One of the strikes killed Hussam Abu Harbeed, a commander in the Islamic Jihad militant group who orchestrated attacks against the Israeli military and civilians for almost 15 years, The Times of Israel reported, citing the IDF. 
In this most recent round of fighting, Palestinian militants in Gaza have fired more than 3,100 rockets into Israel.
At least 198 Palestinians have been killed in the strikes, including 58 children and 35 women, with 1,300 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Eight people in Israel have been killed in rocket attacks launched from Gaza, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.

Ariana Grande and her fiancé of some six months, Dalton Gomez, have tied the knot, Fox News has confirmed.
The recently engaged pair is said to have exchanged their nuptials at Grande’s home in Montecito, California, over the weekend in an intimate ceremony that included fewer than 20 guests from both sides of their respective families.
The singer, 27, took to Instagram in December to share a series of photos of them together. The series also included some snaps of her brand new engagement ring from the 25-year-old real estate broker.
"forever n then some," she captioned the post at the time.
Gomez, a Los Angeles real estate agent, was first linked to the celebrity around Valentine’s Day. TMZ reported in late March that the duo had decided to quarantine together. After that, she made things official once they started to appear on her Instagram Stories together. She confirmed they were dating by way of the music video "Stuck With U," which dropped on May 8. 
"They couldn't be happier, they're just so excited. This is a happy time for them, both sets of parents are thrilled," a source told People shortly after the star announced the news.
A source previously told the outlet that the duo first began dating in January, meaning the engagement comes just shy of their one-year anniversary.
Comedian Pete Davidson and Grande called it quits in October 2018 four months after they became engaged. The "SNL" star has since been linked to Kaia Gerber and Kate Beckinsale, while Grande is now happily married.
"There were a lot of factors that affected their breakup," a source close to Grande told Fox News in 2018 following their split. "Their entire relationship happened incredibly fast and many people in Ariana's own camp were caught off guard when they learned of her engagement to Pete." 
Grande and Davidson’s relationship took a hard left when Grande’s ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died a month before of a suspected drug overdose and the "God Is a Woman" singer became a target for fans of the rapper on social media, the source told us.
"The relationship was a lot, and Mac's death hit her really hard because she tried to help him with his addiction – and the way social media personally attacked her was hard for her to deal with," the source said. "Pete did everything he could to be there for Ariana, but it was never going to be enough. Ariana was shouldering too much."
It was reported at the time that Grande returned her $93,000 engagement ring to Davidson but kept their pet pig.
People magazine also reported on Monday, citing an insider, that "both Ari and Dalton love Montecito," and added that the pair "spend a lot of time there."
"It seems only natural that they would get married at Ari's beautiful and historic house," the insider added.

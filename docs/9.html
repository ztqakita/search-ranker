Vice President Kamala Harris’ recent trip seemed to do little to take the pressure off her and why the administration has yet to send President Biden’s point person to address the migrant surge to the U.S.-Mexico border.
Sunday was the 81st day that Harris hasn’t visited the region since taking on the role of manager of the Biden administration’s response to the migrant crisis, and it seems that Harris will only visit the border on her own terms. 
After a few disastrous interviews, questions about why Harris is avoiding the region are beginning to emerge from unlikely places. 
CNN Sunday anchor Abby Phillip called one of the interviews "just little cringeworthy." She said that she knows that Harris loyalists inside the White House are "just kind of wondering what is going on."
Harris’ critics say that it is obvious why Harris wants to avoid the border. The problem is not an easy one to solve, but it is by far her greatest task. If the crisis continues to unfold, her hopes to be president herself could be dashed. But if she can blame Honduras and Guatemala for a diplomatic stalemate, the administration can easily blame corruption for why the situation cannot be solved.
The White House has stuck to the talking point that visiting the border is simply not Harris’ mandate, and she is looking to solve the larger crisis. 
But her decision not to visit the border is not making the situation on the ground go away.
Speaking to Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on "Sunday Morning Futures," National Border Patrol Council president Brandon Judd said Harris "can’t go to the border – if she goes to the border, she’s going to be expected to solve this problem."
"This is a problem that she created. She even came out and said that she's an advocate for illegal aliens," Judd said. "She's supposed to be an advocate for citizens of this country. Yet, she's coming out and she's saying that she's advocating for lawlessness."

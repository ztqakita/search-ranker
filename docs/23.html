Elisa Donovan has faced great triumphs in Hollywood – and painful losses.
The actress, who starred in "Clueless" and "Sabrina the Teenage Witch," is opening up in a new memoir titled "Wake Me When You Leave." The book, which is currently being turned into a film, explores how the 50-year-old’s career skyrocketed until her show was unexpectedly canceled, her relationship ended and her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
Donovan said she hopes her book will give readers, particularly those struggling with the loss of a loved one, a sense of hope.
The star spoke to Fox News about how she faced her eating disorder while on the set of "Clueless," her relationships with her former castmates today and how writing her story -- as heartbreaking as it was to relive those memories -- helped her heal.
And, I said to my friend who I was with, "Oh, there must be someone famous on the escalator." And, so the two of us were looking around, wondering who it might be, and then we got to the top and they swarmed me. It was me. I went, "Oh, this is a different experience." *laughs*
And, certainly, it was... People turned a blind eye rather than saying, "You need to become healthier." So, I think it's an environment that certainly may endorse it, but I showed up there with those issues long before... I had them long before I arrived in Hollywood, and it was my own responsibility to have to combat them and choose to recover.
But no one made me feel that way. And I loved it. I loved Jason Priestley, he's one of my favorite people in the business. He's such a great human. I loved working with Tori Spelling. Everybody was really great.
 When I initially first wrote it, it was incredibly difficult and unintelligible. Then over time and through the revision process and having that distance that I have now, it was easier to articulate what we were all going through... It was really cathartic for me to be able to put that down... That was really fulfilling for me.
I've walked through all of those challenges. But because I was able to walk through them, I have a richer life today. So, I hope that people really get that from this book, that it's important to acknowledge our difficulties so that we can come through to the other side stronger.

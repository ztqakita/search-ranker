Fox News Poll Methodology Statement
April 2019
The Fox News Poll is directed by Beacon Research (D) (formerly named Anderson RobbinsResearch) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The poll is conducted via telephone among anationally representative sample of approximately 1,000 registered voters. Of the completedinterviews, roughly 25 percent are conducted with respondents on landlines and 75 percent withrespondents on cellphones.
The Fox News Poll uses a dual-frame sample design encompassing landline and cellphones.Both the sample components are designed using a probability proportionate to size method,which means phone numbers for each state are proportional to the number of voters in each state.The landline sample is developed using random digit dial procedures (RDD), in which alllandline numbers (listed and unlisted) in the continental United States have an equal probabilityof being selected.The cellphone sample is also identified using a probability selection method which involves: (1)identifying blocks of telephone numbers that are exclusively cellphones; and (2) randomlygenerating the last two digits and then dialing these numbers within the block.In addition, all respondents are screened to ensure they are registered to vote. In states withoutregistration or same-day registration, respondents are asked about the regularity of their voting behavior. Before elections, interviewers sometimes screen for "likely voters" through a series ofquestions about past voting behavior, vote likelihood, and/or interest in the current election.Quotas are applied to ensure the sample mirrors the proportions of voters nationally.Specifically, gender (53 percent female, 47 percent male) and regional quotas are employed.
All interviews for the Fox News Poll are conducted by live interviewers. Furthermore,interviews are conducted by trained professionals from central, monitored locations. Interviewsare conducted through a computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system, and bothhuman supervisors and software monitor each step of the interviewing process.Dialing is structured such that prospective respondents always find a live interviewer when theyanswer their phone. On average, six calls are placed to each unanswered number during thethree-day period when the poll is fielded.Cellphone respondents are screened to ensure they are not driving or participating in an activitythat requires their full attention.
When necessary, minor weights are used to ensure the demographics of survey respondents arerepresentative of the national registered voter population. Generally, weights are only applied toage, race, education, and area variables. The Fox News Poll is not weighted by political party.
For a sample of about 1,000 interviews, the error due to sampling is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level. For example, when the survey says "47 percent ofvoters…" then the probability is very high that no less than 44 percent and no more than 50 percent of all voters would have responded the same way. Sampling error associated withsubgroup results is higher.
In addition to sampling error, question wording and question order can influence results.

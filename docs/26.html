Eartha Kitt was Hollywood’s ultimate sex kitten, but her greatest role was that of mom.
The legendary singer, actress and dancer, who purred her way into superstardom, passed away on Christmas Day in 2008 at age 81 from colon cancer. Her career spanned six decades and the late star is still celebrated by fans today as Catwoman in the ‘60s hit series "Batman."
Her only child, Kitt Shapiro, has recently written a memoir titled "Eartha & Kitt: A Daughter’s Love Story in Black & White," which details their loving bond over the years. It also sheds new light on Kitt’s life out of the spotlight, where she truly felt like herself as a doting mom.
Shapiro, 59, spoke to Fox News about growing up with the beloved entertainer, her favorite memories and how Kitt really felt about being "the most exciting woman in the world" as Orson Welles once said.
So I thought this was a really cool way to keep the conversation going. This is a story about a woman who had such an incredible impact on this Earth in so many ways. But in many other ways, people don’t know about them. And I think, even if you are a fan of hers, you will definitely learn new things in this book.
But it wasn’t until I grew older that I came to fully understand the impact she had on people. We moved to New York when I was a teenager. We would walk down a street and people would call out her name. But it was all I’ve ever known.  
My mother was a very proper woman. But she was also self-taught. She didn’t learn any of this while growing up in the South or from anyone in her life. But she realized the importance of how you carry yourself, how you treat other people and how you spoke. That always stayed with her. It was important for her to carry herself with pride, speak clearly and have good manners.
My mother endured rejection during those formative years. And the family that she was given to abused her so severely - physically, sexually and emotionally. Those were scars that she carried internally throughout her life. But she didn’t shy away from them because she knew they made her who she was. They gave her strength. And they taught her the importance of how much you should love your children. She would say to me, "You can never love a child too much." And she really believed that. I think that’s what formed her desire to be such a doting, nurturing mother.
That being said, I remember growing up and how my mother and I would stare in the mirror as she was getting ready. We would point out our similarities. I have these little beauty marks and I would always point them out to her. I’m very proud of them.
Recently, people have made presumptions... but it’s also how my mother went through life, fighting the stereotype, the need to put people in boxes... My mother would say to me, "You’re a walking United Nations. You either fill every quota or break every rule." I absolutely believe that I have this incredible makeup of all these different nationalities and ethnic backgrounds from both parents... My mother would say, "You really are a melting pot" and I’m proud of that.
My mother told me an aunt of hers in New York sent for her because she had been told how badly the family who had taken her in was treating her in the South. This aunt lived in Spanish Harlem. My mother would talk about how you could hear the sounds of music and drums and just the rhythm of the city itself. That gave her this inner feeling of movement. So becoming a dancer was something that came very naturally to her. And she understood the power of speech. If you spoke clearly and eloquently, people will treat you differently. They treat you with more respect. And she even learned different languages.
I think all of that shaped my mother. Obviously, she was very beautiful and had an incredible body. But when you put the whole package together, it gives you that sex symbol quality. But she also happened to be very shy... So she found the whole thing amusing in many ways.
I think there are certain decisions, perhaps, that she would have liked to have done differently. But she also understood that everything happens for a reason. And if she had changed anything, she wouldn’t have ended up where she was. So it gave her this understanding that regrets are just a waste of energy.
My parents divorced when I was young. I was an only child and my mother was a single mother. And she had no family really. So it was just her and I. And as a teenager, I wanted to be with my friends. I wanted to hang out and do my own thing. It’s hard. There were many times where I did struggle with that. But that’s sort of the way life is, right?
... It wasn’t easy when I got married even though I didn’t move away and I worked for my mother. We were always very close. You’ll see a picture of my mother at my wedding and we both look like we’re walking the plank *laughs*. it was not an easy day for her or for me. She was happy for me, but she also had a lot of pain from her childhood. She carried a lot of this fear of rejection. And she never got over her childhood... But we were very much mother and daughter. And we adored each other.
... I remember understanding why religion is so important and why people yearn to have faith in a heaven, because this body, which possessed an incredible energy, was now gone. It was mind-blowing. It was so hard. I would look up at the sky for days, weeks, months after she died. I would say, "Where are you? You can’t have just evaporated into the air." It’s a very difficult process to go through, not just death, but grieving. Her life had come to an end, but the rest of the world was still functioning. The sun didn’t stop rising and setting because my mother died, but it felt like my Earth did die.  
It also felt like, "What’s next?" it was just surreal - it’s still is. It’s hard to believe she has been gone for so long. She died in 2008 on Christmas Day and it’s still hard to believe she’s gone.
I hope this book encourages people to have conversations with loved ones because she did love that art of conversation.... We all have a legacy, whether you’re famous or not. And I want people to hold on to those precious moments with their loved ones because it’s what keeps us connected. It’s part of our history. But I also hope this book gives people joy because my mother certainly gave that to me. She still does.

The bride wore white — and her ex? Green.
In a desperate attempt to make her ex-boyfriend jealous, a woman in Germany faked an elaborate wedding to get revenge on an old flame. A TikTok video of her envy-inducing antics has gone viral, with more than 1.8 million views and thousands of gobsmacked comments.
Sarah Vilard, 24, revealed her rock bottom moment to the tune of Gnarls Barkley’s 2006 hit "Crazy," showing pictures of herself holding hands with a groom-for-hire, wearing a long white dress.
"Yup, I’m crazy," she captioned the video.
Vilard, who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, split from her former beau in 2019 and hatched an envy-inducing plan shortly after.
She rented out Frankfurt’s Villa Kennedy and rounded up her friends to play the roles of bridesmaids. She posted the pictures to her Instagram, where she was certain her ex would see.
The crazier thing was: Vilard was "satisfied" with the results, she told Jam Press.
"He found out through Instagram and texted me the next day and freaked out because he thought I was cheating on him while we were together," Vilard said.
"That, of course, wasn’t the case. But he came to my house and wanted to talk to me afterward. I wasn’t interested."
She then blocked and deleted him from her social media and her life.
Comments on Vilard’s video ran the gamut from impressed to perturbed: "This level of dedication is either completely psychotic or absolutely genius," one TikTok commenter wrote.
"I personally see nothing wrong with this," another said.
"LOL, you’ve unlocked a new level of petty, congrats," added another.
Vilard paid no mind to the haters, saying the stunt was ultimately worth it.
"Yes, I am single now and super happy about it," she said. "I’m happy to be able to focus on myself."

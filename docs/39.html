Two Republican U.S. senators kept up the pressure on the Biden-Harris administration this weekend regarding the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Sunday was the 54th consecutive day that Vice President Kamala Harris has neither visited the border region nor held a news conference regarding her role as President Biden’s appointed manager of the federal response to the crisis.
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a vocal critic of Biden and Harris, chose Sunday to tweet out a video clip of a speech he made Thursday, slamming the administration for its border policies.
"Enough is enough," Cruz wrote. "Biden, Kamala, and [Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro] Mayorkas need to stop pretending there is no crisis on our southern border.
"The safety and security of Texans and Americans across the country is at stake."
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., was seen in another clip that was posted Saturday from the same Thursday news conference.
"Kamala Harris could’ve walked to the Texas border in the time that she’s been given the responsibility to solve this problem," Scott said, "and [she has] not done anything."
The White House, meanwhile, continued to downplay the criticism that Biden and Harris have taken regarding the border. It has repeatedly argued that Harris is focused on addressing the "root causes" of migration, in discussions with Latin American leaders, rather than on the vice president making in-person appearances at the border.
"We’re less worried about press conferences or political games that are being played by some," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week, according to Florida Politics.
Biden and Harris have instead been sending representatives to the border. 
On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra toured a migrant shelter in Long Beach, California, The Associated Press reported.
Earlier this month, Mayorkas – who has made several trips to the border – toured a facility in Donna, Texas.

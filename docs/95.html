While it’s impossible to fully predict what mortgage rates will look like in the future, experts can analyze several key indicators to predict future rate trends.
Are you wondering whether you should wait to refinance or buy a home? Take a look at what researchers at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae think rates will look like for the rest of the year. Keep in mind the rates you actually qualify for will be determined by things like your credit score and down payment percentage in addition to current rates, so actual rates will vary. 
Researchers at Freddie Mac expect mortgage rates to rise slightly throughout 2021, citing the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keeping interest rates low for the foreseeable future.
Here are Freddie Mac’s predictions for how 30-year fixed rates will look for the rest of the year:

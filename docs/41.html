President Biden will address a joint session of Congress for the first time on April 28.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Tuesday issued the formal invitation for Biden to speak. The speech is scheduled to occur 98 days into Biden’s first term in office.
"Nearly 100 days ago, when you took the oath of office, you pledged in a spirit of great hope that "Help Is On The Way," Pelosi said in the letter. "Now, because of your historic and transformative leadership, Help Is Here!"
"In that spirit, I am writing to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Wednesday, April 28, to share your vision for addressing the challenges and opportunities of this historic moment," she added.
The White House has yet to formally respond to the invitation, though it can be assumed the date was agreed upon mutually with Democratic leaders.
Biden’s first speech to Congress will occur later into his first term than those of his presidential predecessors. Former President Barack Obama delivered his first speech a joint session of Congress on Feb. 24, 2009. Former President Donald Trump delivered his on Feb. 28, 2017.
Dating back to the Reagan administration, every president before Biden has delivered his first speech to Congress within his first 40 days in office. 
For presidents in the recent past, the speeches have been roughly one hour in length. Former President Bill Clinton spoke for one hour and five minutes, while George H.W. Bush spoke for just 48 minutes.
Biden’s first speech to Congress is not considered a "State of the Union" address. Those addresses are required under the Constitution, and the first is usually scheduled about one year into a president’s term.
Critics have accused the White House of limiting Biden’s public appearances since he entered the Oval Office. The president held his first formal press conference on March 25, roughly two months after his inauguration.  
Biden will speak as his administration attempts to garner congressional support for a $2.25 trillion spending package. The plan includes physical infrastructure projects such as upgrades for roads and bridges as well as funding for Biden-backed policy initiatives such as enhanced job training and caregiving for elderly and disabled Americans.
The president held an Oval Office meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday to discuss the plan. Biden has publicly signaled a desire for a bipartisan agreement, though Democratic leaders are said to be considering the implementation of special budget reconciliation rules to pass the bill with a simple majority vote if talks fail.

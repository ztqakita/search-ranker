The ladies of "Sex and the City" have reunited.
On Friday, Sarah Jessica Parker took to Instagram to share a picture of the first table read for the HBO Max revival.
"1st Table Read. @justlikethatmax Got here to work way too early. Nerves all a wonderful jumble. X, SJ," she captioned the Instagram picture, which featured Parker's name card, a script and a mask. 
The star also shared a photo featuring herself alongside co-stars Cynthia Nixon (Miranda Hobbes) and Kristin Davis (Charlotte York Goldenblatt).
"Together again," Parker captioned the snapshot of the trio alongside a purple heart emoji.
"Read through our first episodes," she added. "@justlikethatmax Alongside all the fellas and our newest cast members. Like an ice cream sundae. X, SJ."
Kim Cattrall, who played the proudly promiscuous publicist Samantha Jones in the hit Emmy-winning series, will not be returning.
HBO Max chief content officer Casey Bloys recently told TVLine that the SATC follow-up will be a realistic portrayal of women in their 50s.
The four women played their respective characters for six seasons and two movies from 1998 until as recently as 2010.

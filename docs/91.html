Now we can move onto the fun stuff. I've got five clever tricks to use with your PC.
If you’re like me, you copy and paste text and images all day long. It’s annoying when you accidentally copy over your last selection. That’s where Clipboard history comes in. You can store up to 25 entries so you can go back and grab your recent selections.
To enable Clipboard history:
If you're on a desktop, here's a great trick you'll use all the time. Hover over a URL with your mouse and tap your mouse wheel. This opens up the link in a new tab.
You can also right-click and select "Open link in new tab," but why do that when this way is so simple?

Do you have someone in your life who needs tech help from time to time? Or maybe you need a guide to help you update your broken drivers or fix some other issue.
Try Quick Assist. It’s super simple to use and you don’t need to download a thing.
Type "quick assist" into your taskbar. You'll see two options: Get assistance or Give assistance. Follow the on-screen instructions to remote in to help.
A word of warning: Only allow this type of access to someone you trust.

Let’s be honest. Navigating through files has never been very easy in Windows 10. Here’s a solution you may like: Files, a third-party file explorer you can download for free from the Microsoft Store.
Files is, well, what the built-in File Explorer should be. It looks fresh and modern, it’s easy to navigate and you can customize it to fit your needs. It syncs well with OneDrive, too.

Have you heard of PowerToys? Think of this as Microsoft’s testing zone. PowerToys are utilities you can add on that extend what your PC can do. They’re not traditional download and install applications. Tap or click here for the instructions to install PowerToys.
There are a handful of great add-ons, but one I like most is Fancy Zones. If you’re someone who keeps multiple windows and programs open, it’s a must.
With FancyZones, you can set up a grid layout to your liking, and then your open Windows can quickly snap into place. Drag a window into one of your zones and it will be resized and repositioned automatically into place. To install it, follow the directions above to enable PowerToys, then follow these steps.

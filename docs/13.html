Editor of "Extraordinary Beliefs," Jeremy Corbell joined "Fox News Primetime" to discuss what Americans may learn from the Pentagon's declassified UFO report.
CORBELL: We are witnessing, observing, picking up on every type of data that our military has advanced aerospace vehicles that are able to outmaneuver our greatest warplanes. They are penetrating and there are incursions in our most restricted airspace around our nuclear weapons. This is something that the military is very interested in, and they have been lying to the American public. We now know that in 1969 Project Blue Book ended, but there were other UFO programs. So now we're at a place where we see these objects flying with impunity. You have Commander David Fravor with a tic-tac UFO, you have all these pilots coming forward and obviously to me numerous individuals providing footage that have been confirmed by the Pentagon. So now, you know, we do know, UFOs are real. Now what they are, you know, maybe as well as I do. We all got to find out."Fox News Primetime" host Will Cain also spoke to UFO witness Thom Reed who detailed his alleged encounter.

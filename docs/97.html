If you’re looking for a way to tap your home equity, cash-out refinances and home equity loans are two of your options. Both allow you to turn home equity into cash for home improvements, debt consolidation, or other expenses. However, the process for obtaining them — not to mention paying them off — is slightly different.
A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage loan with a new one. Your new loan will be larger than your current one, and you’ll take the difference between the two balances in cash.

A HELOC is typically best if:
If you’re deciding between a home equity loan or HELOC vs. a cash-out refinance, be sure to consider your goals, budget, and unique financial situation. All three options can be smart ways to access your home equity.

These hairy hounds prove that humans weren't the only ones rushing to the barbers - as the pampered pooches were also treated to long-overdue haircuts.
The long-haired dog breeds, including poodles, labradoodles, spaniels, and a Pomeranian, would usually have a haircut at least every six weeks. But with dog groomers having been closed during the winter lockdown, the dogs were in dire need of a serious trim when groomers [in England] finally reopened their doors on Monday. And among the first pooches back through the doors were some of the regular customers at Bone Idol groomers in Brighton, East Sussex.
Happy customers such as Joey the Border terrier and Nellie the Welsh terrier had serious snips, leaving behind a mountain of fur that was about half the height of the pooches themselves. And others, such as Lola the cockapoo, were finally able to see straight again - after having their furry fringes cut back from where they had grown over their eyes.
Bone Idol owner Scott Learmouth, said "Our customers and their dogs love coming to the salon, and we love to see them, so the lockdown once again has been really hard for everyone. On the first day of opening, and for the foreseeable future we have a packed schedule, and it is really satisfying to see the transformations from drab to fabulous once more."
The Bone Idol business also extends to the Bone Idol Academy, which trains would-be dog groomers. Scott said that that part of the business has seen a giant surge in applications since the start of the pandemic.
He added: "While we have of course been subject to restrictions like most retail businesses, dog grooming is a flexible occupation. It's also really fun and creative, and people who have been stuck in lockdown home working in jobs they don't like are coming to dog grooming and starting their dream career."
"The pandemic has been a real time for reflection for many people."

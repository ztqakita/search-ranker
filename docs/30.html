Andrea Meza’s life forever changed when she heard the words "Viva Mexico."
In May, the beauty queen beat out Miss Brazil, becoming the 69th Miss Universe. Previous winner Zozibini Tunzi from South Africa held the title since December 2019. Last year’s ceremony was canceled due to the pandemic.
The pageant was hosted by Mario Lopez and Olivia Culpo, the 2012 Miss Universe. It was broadcast live from the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood in Florida.
The Miss Universe competition airs in more than 160 territories and countries across the globe including in the U.S. on the FYI channel and Telemundo.
The 26-year-old spoke to Fox News about representing Mexico, why she decided to participate in the pageant and how she hopes to show a real side to herself on social media.
Every time I see the video now, I think it’s funny because I’m super excited. I didn’t believe what was happening. You can’t hear it, but I was jumping and screaming. I could feel my whole country there with me because the audience was going crazy. And I could see all the flags. I’m so grateful I got to feel so much love at that very moment.
I wanted to show people there’s nothing to be afraid of. I know when there’s something new, and we don’t know a lot about it, we could have our concerns. But we have to trust the science. This is for the well-being of everyone.
Sometimes we’re afraid to try because of failure or we just feel vulnerable. But I want to tell them that being vulnerable is OK. That makes us human. And that’s OK if we’re afraid. We can only try. Once you step out of your comfort zone, you’ll realize that you’re capable of doing amazing things.
The guy, my so-called husband, is actually a friend. And that’s the story. It was on my social media. I never thought about deleting it because I thought it was obvious that I’m a model and do these kinds of campaigns. But when I won, people started digging and they found it. And then it went viral *laughs*.
I want to give women a voice. I want to let the world know the conditions of the Latin community here in the States, as well as in general. I want to raise awareness of gender-based violence because it happens all around the world, not just in Mexico or the Latin community. We need to create awareness for it. And for me, it’s only beginning.
